## Overview

Welcome to the **Superhero Mission Control Heap Challenge**! 
This program allows you to manage superhero mission tasks based on priority using heaps.
The tasks are represented by integer priority levels, where higher values indicate higher priority. 
The heap data structure is used to efficiently insert, remove, and reorganize tasks. 
The heap structure is visualized as a tree, and colorful outputs provide an engaging user experience.

### Learning Goals

By completing this challenge, participants will:
- Understand the concept of heaps and their operations.
- Learn how to implement insertion and deletion in Max-Heaps.
- Understand how to heapify an array into a Min-Heap.
- Visualize a heap structure as a tree.
- Experience a fun and interactive theme while working with heap data structures.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Insert Superhero Tasks into a Max-Heap
- You will insert superhero tasks (represented by their priority level) into a **Max-Heap**.
- The priority is represented as an integer, where higher values have higher priority.
- After each insertion, the Max-Heap will be displayed as a tree structure.

#### Steps:
1. Input a task's priority level (e.g., 40, 25, 10, etc.).
2. To stop inserting tasks, input `-1`.
3. The heap will be displayed as a tree after each insertion.

---

### Task 2: Remove the Root Task from the Max-Heap
- The root task, which has the highest priority, will be removed from the heap.
- After each deletion, the heap will be displayed as a tree.

#### Steps:
1. The program will automatically remove the root task from the Max-Heap.
2. The updated heap will be displayed after each deletion.

---

### Task 3: Heapify a Random List into a Min-Heap
- You will input a list of integers that represent task priorities.
- The list will be heapified into a **Min-Heap**, and the tree will be displayed.

#### Steps:
1. Enter a list of priorities as space-separated integers (e.g., `30 20 15 5 10`).
2. The list will be displayed as a Min-Heap after conversion.
